In the meantime I heard Huawei etc bought a few years' license right before the trade war, they're actually well prepared. Another way is to restrict chip manufacturing, Taiwan pretty much owns the best technology for that(TSMC), Intel/Samsung has some, Huawei has none. And you have Android to some degree, without Android there is no Smartphone dominance from China as of now. Open source in general helped China to catch up and overtake the west extremely efficiently, you don't need any business spies anymore, just download/modify/profit. At the moment USA still has the possibility to contain IC ecosystem if it really wants to do that. In 10~20 years it will be a different story though, by then USA might not have much leverage if anything at all left.</td>\n",

One of amazons biggest moats (imo) is that they can realize monumental cost savings on bandwidth while making it very pricy to other service providers. So if you need to architect bandwidth-hungry or “high scale” applications, going outside of AWS becomes way too expensive. Even privatelink tacks on bandwidth charges. You’d have to look at DB providers like Elastic to see how to do this, I think. But it’s going to involve a very complex and high touch deployment &amp; support environment. This effectively “prices out” certain classes of applications as too expensive for value returned. Again I could be looking at this very wrong, and figuring out how to build profitable unbundled AWS services would be a great business, but it’s hard to see how to successfully execute.</td>\n",

Another way is to restrict chip manufacturing, Taiwan pretty much owns the best technology for that(TSMC), Intel/Samsung has some, Huawei has none.

One of amazons biggest moats (imo) is that they can realize monumental cost savings on bandwidth while making it very pricy to other service providers. So if you need to architect bandwidth-hungry or “high scale” applications, going outside of AWS becomes way too expensive. Even privatelink tacks on bandwidth charges. You’d have to look at DB providers like Elastic to see how to do this, I think. But it’s going to involve a very complex and high touch deployment &amp; support environment. This effectively “prices out” certain classes of applications as too expensive for value returned. Again I could be looking at this very wrong, and figuring out how to build profitable unbundled AWS services would be a great business, but it’s hard to see how to successfully execute.</td>\n",

In the meantime I heard Huawei etc bought a few years' license right before the trade war, they're actually well prepared. Another way is to restrict chip manufacturing, Taiwan pretty much owns the best technology for that(TSMC), Intel/Samsung has some, Huawei has none. And you have Android to some degree, without Android there is no Smartphone dominance from China as of now. Open source in general helped China to catch up and overtake the west extremely efficiently, you don't need any business spies anymore, just download/modify/profit. At the moment USA still has the possibility to contain IC ecosystem if it really wants to do that. In 10~20 years it will be a different story though, by then USA might not have much leverage if anything at all left.</td>\n",

One of amazons biggest moats (imo) is that they can realize monumental cost savings on bandwidth while making it very pricy to other service providers. So if you need to architect bandwidth-hungry or “high scale” applications, going outside of AWS becomes way too expensive. Even privatelink tacks on bandwidth charges. You’d have to look at DB providers like Elastic to see how to do this, I think. But it’s going to involve a very complex and high touch deployment &amp; support environment. This effectively “prices out” certain classes of applications as too expensive for value returned. Again I could be looking at this very wrong, and figuring out how to build profitable unbundled AWS services would be a great business, but it’s hard to see how to successfully execute.</td>\n",

We really shouldn't continue nurturing the selfishness and greed traits on a mass scale as we currently do. Socialism is never about people working for free or forcing lazy people to work. Its about workers owning the means of production. Giving workers dignity and eliminating the oppresive employer - employee relationship. Slave owners also thought that they were unfairly being \"forced\" to give up their freedoms of owning people.</td>\n",

Just use it as is and see how it does. 2. Create a language model containing just those 10 words so that the engine is constrained to that vocabulary, which should improve accuracy. 3. Train a (smaller) model from scratch, which requires (audio, transcript) pairs. This is basically research work, there's no recipe you can just follow. The advantage is that if you can make it work, it can be a much smaller model than  a model trained for general English dictation. &gt; 2. I want to speak into my microphone (available as a Pulseaudio device) and recognise the words and output the words as a text stream on stdout. How do I do this? We have a few examples with microphone input, but they're all based on voice activity detection:  https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/tree/master/examples I should write an example that is just continuous streaming and output without any voice activity detection.

Then they sent another – same exact amount, same address, different reference number. I called them to say the bill was already paid and they confirmed over the phone that they could see the payment for the other bill, but they couldn’t trash the new one for some reason and to avoid any extra charges I had to pay it and then ask for a refund. I remarked how dumb that was, but acquiesced and paid the thing only to then ask for a refund. They said it’d be processed within a couple of weeks, but of course it never was, so I called again. And again. And again. About six months later I just gave up, and accepted that Thames Water will forever owe me some £500 or so, and I’ll never get them back.

Gun control proponents often bring up and praise the UK (near total ban) and Australia (significant limitations compared to the U.S.) as examples to emulate. And in Chicago and DC, before the Supreme Court cases, there were effectively total bans.  And when the plaintiffs sued, they didn't say, \"well I guess we went a little too far, let's establish a regulated framework under which responsible, qualified and trained citizens can own guns\".  Instead, they went all the way to the Supreme Court to try to defend their bans. So, even if a gun owner agrees with a particular piece of proposed regulation (and I'm sure plenty do), they would be acting against their own long term interests giving the block trying to ban guns political momentum and capital.</td>\n",

It's semantically wrong for the browser to pretend that the document belongs to the domain, and even more wrong when the signed document is being served by another domain with a completely different cert, google's! Even app stores don't do that - if you download a signed app from any domain, it won't pretend it s downloaded from apple.com but it will report that its signed from Apple Inc. The situation is not analogous anyway because there are very few app stores from 3-4 highly trusted corporates. If any of their app store private keys are stolen the internet is fucked.</td>\n",

Allowing suspects to refuse to answer questions--a/k/a \"remaining silent\"--means that some people who commit crimes won't self-incriminate, and won't wind up being \"punished.\" Interrogating suspects without a lawyer present is a related tool for solving more burglaries. Allowing suspects to have a lawyer present during interrogation definitely means that some people who commit burglaries won't be \"punished.\" So advocating for the right of suspects to remain silent, and to have a lawyer present during interrogation are both indirect ways of advocating for people committing burglaries to not be punished. Same for advocating that police evidence which is \"fruit of the poisoned tree\" not be admissible in court. Or really, for any limitation on enforcement. It's all implicitly choosing that allowing some people who commit crimes to go free, serves a greater good. TL;DR The phrase \"Advocating that people committing burglaries not be punished\" has a lot of nuänce to it. Best not to try to spin it as a simple boolean. --- There's another thing, which is the word \"punished.\" Punishment is not, and should not, be a goal in any civilized society. That's a whole 'nother discussion, but for the purpose of discussing surveillance, let's agree that we are talking about convicting people who commit crimes, and leave the discussion fo what to do after obtaining a conviction for another day.</td>\n",
